# EVA6: DAWN OF THE TRANSFORMERS

![](resources/2991289.png)


### how to interpret the repo:

1) Each session has it's own dedicated directory with a a README file, which would help to give an overview for that session.

2) `minigrad` is an attempt to understand and have a minimalistic Auto-grad engine with capability to develop full working Neural Networks. Inspired from Andrej Karpathy's micrograd. Will keep understanding and adding more operations along with features as I go along.

3) Extra resources like images or gifs would go under resources folder

4) Experiments will hold notebooks for sometimes session based tests or something different, but will revolve around CV.



### TODO:
1. Complete README for all existing session dirs
2. Improve main README
3. Implement Backward pass for minigrad and add more operations. Inspiration for enhancements is GeoHotz's TinyGrad repo, basic idea from Andrej's repo.
